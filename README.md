# I would like to introduce you to my [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=go_starter&utm_content=homepage) friend, Cornelius

![a corn snake](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8124558/132770698-160c6a6a-5b30-4b7d-9448-8982010b2027.jpg)

Cornelius is built with Rust, and they are a wiggly darling.


## Really Serious Snake Etiquette

Remember to always treat Cornelius like a proper little snake. Don't refer to their brain as "code"; respect their snakeness. Cornelius uses "They"/"Them" pronouns.

For example, rather than saying "We need to fix the bug where they don't go to `0, 0`", you should say "The poor little love, Cornelius, is afraid of `0, 0` on the board and could do with some help getting there".

## Technologies Used

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)

## Running Tests
Cornelius's test suite can be run with `cargo test`.

## Playing Battlesnake

### Completing Challenges

If you're looking for the Single Player Mode of Battlesnake, or something to practice with between events, check out [Challenges.](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/quick-start-challenges-guide)

### Joining a Battlesnake Arena

Once you've made your Battlesnake behave and survive on its own, you can enter it into the [Global Battlesnake Arena](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/global) to see how it performs against other Battlesnakes worldwide.

Arenas will regularly create new games and rank Battlesnakes based on their results. They're a good way to get regular feedback on how well your Battlesnake is performing, and a fun way to track your progress as you develop your algorithm.

### Joining a Battlesnake League
